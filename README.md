# CineMatch.io : Movies Recommandation System

## Description
CineMatch.io is an experimental movie recommendation system that uses machine learning and data analysis to deliver a personalized experience to its users. </br>
Our goal is to connect cinephiles with films they will love, but have not yet discovered. </br>

By analyzing several variables such as synopsis, genres, ratings, CineMatch.io manages to create custom recommendations that meet the unique tastes of each user. </br>

The underlying algorithm uses content-based filtering, relying on a rich movie database extracted from www.tmdb.com through the API. </br> 

## Fonctionnality
CineMatch.io is centered around a content-based filtering approach, with a particular focus on natural language processing (NLP) to provide a unique and accurate movie recommendation experience. </br>
Here are the main features the app offers:

- **Movie Search by Title**: Enter the title of a movie you like in the search bar. The system uses this starting point to find and recommend similar films.

- **Recommendations Based on NLP**: The algorithm thoroughly analyzes movie synopsis, reviews, and descriptions to find films that match not only by genre, but also by theme, mood, and narration. </br>
This approach ensures that the recommendations are aligned with the subtle nuances of your cinematic preferences.

- **Viewing Six Similar Movies**: For each search, the system displays six movies that are very similar to your initial choice. This allows you to discover movies that are closely aligned with your tastes and preferences.

- **Simplified User Experience**: The app is designed to be simple and straightforward. No distractions or unnecessary complications - just you, your starting movie, and a set of relevant recommendations.

- **Continuous Database Update**: The movie database is regularly updated to include new releases and classics, ensuring our recommendations remain current and diverse.
